# Libraries

This folder contains the builtin libraries of cult. These libraries can be seen as special, but are effectively "just" interpreter extensions. All of these libraries are designed to be used with the "builtin" loader. We list the libraries below:

* `builtin:cult.system`: This is the cult system, all the symbols required for the language to function. This is always imported automatically.
* `builtin:cult.core`: This is a meta module importing the core cult library, effectively the "standard" library.
